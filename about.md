Welcome! I'm a former music student, recovering lawyer, and self-taught developer-in-training. This blog is where I hope to share my progress as I learn more about web development, and share my experience trying new tools, tutorials, and techniques. I'll also write about legal topics that catch my eye and seem relevant to tech, music, or general web culture. As I grow as a developer, I'll also share some of my projects.

For more, read my [_Hello, World_ Post](/general/2017/11/07/Hello-World.html).
